# Apple-Card

On March 25,2019 Apple held an [event](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2019/) announcing it’s new services plans. This included [Apple Card](https://www.apple.com/apple-card/). I thought that I looked very interesting and that the UI was different than most of the first party applications that Apple has available. As such, I was intrigued and very much wanted to get the card and explore the app that came with it.  Unfortunately it was announced that it wouldn’t be be available until this summer. Not to be deterred I thought I would make my own version of the Apple Card App! This is just a simulation of what I expected Apple’s final application to look and feel like. The entire thing was based off the videos and photos that the company has announced. I have no information about the actual application. This is entirely a interactive UI mock up.

### Getting Started

All you need to do to use this application is to clone the project and change the developer team and hit run! 


### Language

This entire project was coded in Swift 5.
